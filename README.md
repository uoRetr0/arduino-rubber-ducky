# Arduino Rubber Ducky Project

![Demo](https://github.com/uoRetr0/arduino-rubber-ducky/blob/main/showcase.gif)

Transform your Arduino into a keystroke-automation tool with this low-cost alternative to the [USB Rubber Ducky](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky), designed for ethical hacking, testing, and automation tasks.

## Overview

This project enables an Arduino to act as a Human Interface Device (HID), executing pre-programmed keystroke sequences. It's designed for cybersecurity enthusiasts, educators, and professionals looking for an accessible and versatile tool for automation and testing purposes.

## Features

- **Custom Scripting**: Easily create and deploy keystroke sequences.
- **Broad Compatibility**: Works with Arduino Leonardo, Micro, and others.
- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for learning about HID attacks and defenses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Compatible Arduino board.
- Arduino IDE.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/uoRetr0/arduino-rubber-ducky.git`
2. Open the Arduino IDE, select your board and port.
3. Load the script from this repository and upload it to your Arduino.

## Usage

The Arduino will mimic a USB keyboard, executing the keystroke sequence upon connection to a computer. Customize the script to fit your specific needs.
